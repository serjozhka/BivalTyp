This folder contains two files that are relevant for my 2020 paper submitted to ALP (Acta Linguistica Petropolitana).

One file is a spereadsheet with data on bivalent patterns in 83 lgs used as a background for the analysis of patterns in NENA (Noth-Eastern Neo-Aramaic) varieties spoken in Urmia, Krasnodar Krai.

Another files is the R code I used to analyse these data.
